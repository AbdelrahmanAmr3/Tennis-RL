#### Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree
### Project 3: Multi-Agent Collaboration & Competition
# Train Two RL Agents to Play Tennis
![Trained Agent][image1]

## Project Background:
In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1. If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01. Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

The observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation. Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,

- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores.
- This yields a single score for each episode.
The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those scores is at least +0.5.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to train two RL agents to play tennis. As in real tennis, the goal of each player is to keep the ball in play. And, when you have two equally matched opponents, you tend to see fairly long exchanges where the players hit the ball back and forth over the net.

## Approach
Here are the high-level steps taken in building an agent that solves this environment.

1. Establish performance baseline using a random action policy.
1. Select an appropriate algorithm and begin implementing it.
1. Run experiments, make revisions, and retrain the agent until the performance threshold is reached.

## Results
Once all of the above components were in place, the agents were able to solve the Tennis environment. Again, the performance goal is an average reward of at least +0.5 over 100 episodes, taking the best score from either agent for a given episode.

[Here](https://youtu.be/jOWWzygOi1A) is a video showing the trained agents playing a few points.

The graph below shows the final training results. The best-performing agents were able to solve the environment in 607 episodes, with a top score of 5.2 and a top moving average of 0.927. The complete set of results and steps can be found in [this notebook](Tennis.ipynb).

## Future Improvements
- **Address stability issues to produce more consistent results** &mdash; My "best" results are only reproducible if you run the model numerous times. If you just run it once (or even 3-5 times) the model might not converge. I ran the model at least 30 while searching for a good set of hyperparameters, so perhaps implementing a more systemic approach such as grid search would help. Otherwise, more research is needed to find a more stable algorithm, or to make changes to the current DDPG algorithm.
- **Add *prioritized* experience replay** &mdash; Rather than selecting experience tuples randomly, prioritized replay selects experiences based on a priority value that is correlated with the magnitude of error. This can improve learning by increasing the probability that rare or important experience vectors are sampled.
- **Batch Normalization** &mdash; I did not use batch normalization on this project, but I probably should have. I've used batch normalization many times in the past when building convolutional neural networks (CNN), in order to squash pixel values. But, it didn't occur to me that it would be to this project. This is an aspect of this [Google DeepMind paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf) that has proved tremendously useful in my implementation of other projects.
  - Similar to the exploding gradient issue mentioned above, running computations on large input values and model parameters can inhibit learning. Batch normalization addresses this problem by scaling the features to be within the same range throughout the model and across different environments and units. In additional to normalizing each dimension to have unit mean and variance, the range of values is often much smaller, typically between 0 and 1.
  - You can find batch normalization implemented [here](https://github.com/tommytracey/DeepRL-P2-Continuous-Control/blob/master/model.py#L41) for the actor, and [here](https://github.com/tommytracey/DeepRL-P2-Continuous-Control/blob/master/model.py#L75) for the critic, within `model.py` of the source code of my previous project. These greatly improved model performance.

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86_64.zip)

    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the "headless" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent.  (_To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above._)

2. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `p3_collab-compet/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file.

### Instructions
You can run the code using the following command in your terminal:

You can also follow the instructions in `Tennis.ipynb`.


### (Optional) Challenge: Crawler Environment

After you have successfully completed the project, you might like to solve the more difficult **Soccer** environment.

![Soccer][image3]

In this environment, the goal is to train a team of agents to play soccer.  

You can read more about this environment in the ML-Agents GitHub [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#soccer-twos).  To solve this harder task, you'll need to download a new Unity environment.  (**Note**: Udacity students should not submit a project with this new environment.)

You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
- Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Soccer/Soccer_Linux.zip)
- Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Soccer/Soccer.app.zip)
- Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Soccer/Soccer_Windows_x86.zip)
- Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Soccer/Soccer_Windows_x86_64.zip)

Then, place the file in the `p3_collab-compet/` folder in the DRLND GitHub repository, and unzip (or decompress) the file.  Next, open `Soccer.ipynb` and follow the instructions to learn how to use the Python API to control the agent.

(_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agents on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Soccer/Soccer_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the "headless" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agents without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agents.  (_To watch the agents, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above._)
